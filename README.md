# Orbital-Resonance-Newtonian-Mechanics
Our team was awarded an Honorable Mention in the 2019 Princeton University Explorer Competion, a research contest organized by Princeton alumni.

Using advanced Newtonian Mechanics, we studied Spin-Orbit and Orbit-Orbit Resonance, reaching conclusions about stable system configurations.
